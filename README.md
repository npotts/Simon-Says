Simon Sings
==========

Simon Sings is a simple firmware edit to turn the sparkfun Simon Says kit into a toy more adequate for a 2 year old.  Simon Says now plays tones based on which key is pressed.

The Simon Sings firmware (located under **/Firmware**) will cause your Simon Says kit sing depending on which button is pressed. You will need to manually add connections to a TTL level RS232 port (Ground, TxD, RxD, and DTR) in order to program via arduino.
